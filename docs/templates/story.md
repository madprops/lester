## Garby The Grumpy Trashcan

![](https://i.imgur.com/OakeT6E.jpg)

here comes Garby

his stare follows him down the hall

he takes a quick look to the other people in the room

one of them stands up and stops him

they look at each other for hours

‘let me go’ finally says Garby

‘not until you tell me why you are always grumpy’

Garby stands still not saying a word

‘just tell me’

a yellow glove opens up the roof and inserts a piece of shit into Garby’s mouth

Garby’s eyes pop out and sigh

‘i dont like this guy he is too weak’

the eyes crawl over the guy making questions and replace his original eyes

Garby walks away crashing with a wall and bleeding to death
