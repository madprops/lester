<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OakeT6E.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>here comes Garby</p>
<p>his stare follows him down the hall</p>
<p>he takes a quick look to the other people in the room</p>
<p>one of them stands up and stops him</p>
<p>they look at each other for hours</p>
<p>‘let me go’ finally says Garby</p>
<p>‘not until you tell me why you are always grumpy’</p>
<p>Garby stands still not saying a word</p>
<p>‘just tell me’</p>
<p>a yellow glove opens up the roof and inserts a piece of shit into Garby’s mouth</p>
<p>Garby’s eyes pop out and sigh</p>
<p>‘i dont like this guy he is too weak’</p>
<p>the eyes crawl over the guy making questions and replace his original eyes</p>
<p>Garby walks away crashing with a wall and bleeding to death</p>
